# Train-Scheduler

A train scheduling web application that displays train arrival and departure data that the user submits.

## How To Use

* Type in the information for your train at the submit form at the bottom of the page.
* The parameters are train name, destination, first train time, and frequency.
* Click submit
* Your new train's name, destination, frequency, as well as the current next arrival and minutes away will be displayed at the bottom of the list.

## How It Works

Firebase is used to record train arrival and departure data that the user submits. 
The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Javascript/jQuery.
Moment.js is used to calculate the arrival time and minutes away based on user input.
