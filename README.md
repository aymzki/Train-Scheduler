# Train-Scheduler

A train scheduling app that takes the user's inputs, loads it into Firebase, then returns it as text on the site with conversions to predict the next train arrival time and how many minutes away the train is. 

## How It Works

* Type in the information for your train at the submit form at the bottom of the page.
* The parameters are train name, destination, first train time, and frequency.
* Click submit
* Your new train's name, destination, frequency, as well as the current next arrival and minutes away will be displayed at the bottom of the list.
